#What is control flow?
#It can be thought of as a set of checklists, starting from the top and ending at the bottom.
#Python executes scripts from the top down (iterative), so it is our job to tell the computer when it should execute certain blocks of code.

#Boolean expressions
print("A boolean expression is a statement that can be true or false")
print("")

#Relational operators
print("Boolean expressions can be created by using relational and logical operators")
print("Relational operators compare two values and return true or false.")
print("Logical operators are used to combine multiple Boolean expressions")
print("An example of a relational operator is the equals operator (==)")
print("")

#If statements
print("Boolean variables and expressions are the building blocks of conditional statements")
print("For example, if it is raining, bring an unbrella, if not, bring a t shirt, would be an If statement.")
print("")

#Relational Operators 2
print("Some additional relational operators could include:")
print("> (greater than) and >= (greater than or equal to)")
print("< (less than) and <= (less than or equal to)")
print("")
