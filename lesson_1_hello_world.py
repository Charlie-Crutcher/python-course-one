#Print function
print("")
print("The print() function is used to display things in the console.")
print("It can display variables, text, numbers etc.")
print("This can be useful for things such as debugging.")
print("")

#Comments
print("Comments ignore the syntax and are for human use.")
print("")
print("Comments are important because:")
print("1. They can provide context")
print("2. They can help others read the code better")
print("")

#Strings
print("Blocks of text are refered to as 'strings'.")
print("When declaring a string, it must be surrounded by either double OR single quotes ("" or '')")
print("Multi-line strings can be declared by use of three double OR single quotes either side (''' ''') ")
print("")

#Variables
print("In programming, variables are created to store data for reuse.")
print("This could be a user ID, or an employee name etc.")
print("To create a variable, you assign it using the equals sign.")
print("")
print("An example could be: message_string_example = 'this is a string example.' ")
print("It could then be changed or altered and reused.")
print("")

#Errors
print("Two common errors in python are SyntaxError and NameError.")
print("SyntaxError: something is wrong with the way the program is written.")
print("NameError: an unrecognized word, such as an undefined variable.")
print("")

#Numbers
print("Python has a few numberic data types, which each have different ways of storing numbers")
print("int(integer). stores a whole number with no decimal point.")
print("float(floating point number). stores decimals.")
print("Sometimes floats can behave in unexpected ways due to how the computers store them.")
print("This is because they cannot be respresented as binary fractions, and are instead approximated, for example")
print("1/3 becomes 0.3 or 0.33333, but no matter how many digits you can write, it will never equal exactly 1/3.")
print("")

#Calculations
print("Python can perform arithemetic operations extremely quickly and efficiently.")
print("The Error 'ZeroDivisionError' can occur whilst attempting to divide by 0.")
print("")

#Order of Operations
print("Python evaluates expressions in order of precedence as follows:")
print("1. Items in parentheses (...) ")
print("2. Exponentiation (**) ")
print("3. Multiplication and division")
print("4. Addition and subtraction")
print("5. Comparison (<, >= etc) ")
print("6. Equality (== & !=) ")
print("7. not")
print("8. and")
print("9. or")
print("")

#Concatenation
print("The + operator can also add two strings as well as two numbers.")
print("The process of combining two strings is called string concatenation.")
print("If you want to concatenate a string with a number you will need to convert the number using the str() function.")
print("")

#Plus equals
print("A shorthand method for updating variables is the += operator.")
print("This simply adds to the current value of the variable.")
